1. In views.py I commented out: 
    if pword not in graphs.keys():
                graphs[pword] = Counter(f'counter_{pword}', 'The total number of '\
                + f'times {pword} was used')
            graphs[pword].inc()
    This would save the user passwords for scarping which would not be a good idea.

2. In views.py I added:
    graphs['404_counter'] = Counter('python_request_404_returned', 'The total number'\
    + ' of 404 reponses returned.')

    I also added graphs['404_counter'].inc() whenever I saw return HttpResponse("ERROR: 404 Not Found.") or something similar

3. To install Prometheus:
        brew install helm
        helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
        helm repo update
        helm install my-prometheus stable/prometheus
    
    To connect to Prometheus:
        export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=server" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
        kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9090
        You can then go to localhost:9090 in browser and see that no data is being collected from the GiftcardSite

    Add a scrape_config to GiftcardSite:
        KUBE_EDITOR="nano" kubectl edit configmap my-prometheus-server
        Add:
         - job_name: giftcardsite
           scrape_interval: 15s
           scheme: http
           static_configs:
           - targets:
            - proxy-service:8080
           metrics_path: '/metrics'
           (added under scrape_config)

    If you go to the localhost:9090 under the graph tab and type in python_request_404_returned_total you'll be able to see a historical view of the counter

    I also included the prometheus.yaml file
