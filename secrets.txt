I changed three files that had secrets in them. They were settings.py, db-deployment.yaml and django-deploy.yaml
In settings.py I changed SECRET_KEY = 'kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l' to SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')
I then added a django_secretKey.yaml file to create the secret in kubernetes.
In db-deployment.yaml I deleted:  
- name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
    value: thisisatestthing.

and added:
 envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: mysql

In django-deploy.yaml I deleted:

 - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: thisisatestthing. 

and added:
 envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: mysql

            - secretRef:
                name: django

I then created a file mysql_secretKey.yaml to create the secret in kubernetes.

I then ran the following commands:
kubectl apply -f mysql_secretKey.yaml
kubectl apply -f django_secretKey.yaml

I then created a user and logged in to make sure it worked.
